# Chapter 18: Properties

## What is encapsulation?

Encapsulation is a principle consisiting of hiding or protecting some data of our obects.

To acess to our attributes, we'll create accessors and mutators methods to access or change our data.
This way, we'll ave 2 methods that resemble each other.
This can be a little bit confusing.

Python has a different philosophy in handling such situations.
Any attribute we're accessing without a specific action in mind, we can directly call the method: my_object.my_attribute.
